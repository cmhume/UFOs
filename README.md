# UFOs


## Overview:


The purpose of this analysis was to create a web application that allowed users to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape from the original data file.  An index.html file was adjusted to to have five input boxes and the app.js file filtered search results from the data.js file by noticing a change in the website's input boxes and returning a table with data results that contained the search criteria.  The files included in this project are data.js, app.js, style.css, and index.html.  The data.js file is an array of dictionaries, including information on the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments for each UFO sighting.

## Summary:


### Drawbacks of UFO webpage-


One drawback of the UFO webpage is no information on how the UFO sighting data was compiled, the credibility of each sighting, the person that posted each sighting, or the number of witnesses for each sighting is available.  The user has to trust the data without knowing it source or reliability.
